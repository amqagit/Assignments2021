		1. Explain data type in Java with example
		When we use any data in Java, we must announce it to Java what types of data it is so that Java can understand. There are many data types; for example:
		int		: Any whole number (1,2,3, to infinite)
		String		: Any texts, numbers, and special characters within double quotes. It starts with a 
		                               uppercase S; for example:
		                               ( “meet me @ 23 bridge st.” )
		char		: It can contain only one character within single quotes; i.e.  ‘a’ , ‘b’ , ‘z’
		double/ float	: Any numbers with a decimal (.); example: 1.2, 3.5, 8.1 to infinity
		Boolean	: It represents True or False statement. It can only have true or false states.

//		2 what is variable in Java?
//		A variable is a name assigned to a memory location for Java. It works like a storage space where we can store any data.

//		3 how to store and declare data in Java write the syntax
//		We can store and declare data in java by announcing the data type, give a name for a variable, and finally providing a value; for example:
		int Age =27;

//		4. Store data 100 in variable ‘mark’
		int mark=100;

//		5. Store your school name and print using Java 
		String school="NextTech";
		System.out.println(school);
